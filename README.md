1. Scoring System: Evaluates projects across six dimensions: technology, engagement, efficiency, practicality, scalability, and impact.

2. Automated Analytics Reports: Generates periodic summaries of patient data, including stage transitions, sentiment trends, and scoring metrics.
3. Customizable Metrics: Supports custom metrics for efficiency, business value, scalability, and impact.
4. Simulated Data: Includes a built-in function to simulate patient data for testing and demos.

**Tech Stack**

- Fetch.AI: For decentralized agent deployment and communication.
- Python: Core programming language.
- uAgents Framework: For agent creation and interaction.
- Logging: For detailed tracking of analytics and processes.
