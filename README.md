** VaxInsight: AI-Powered Healthcare Journey Analytics **
VaxInsight is a Fetch.AI-powered agent designed to analyze patient journeys and sentiments in real-time, providing actionable insights for healthcare professionals. By leveraging AI, blockchain, and advanced analytics, VaxInsight helps improve healthcare decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and enhance patient engagement.

**Features**
Real-Time Patient Journey Analysis: Tracks patient stages (e.g., hesitant, researching, accepting) and sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

1. Scoring System: Evaluates projects across six dimensions: technology, engagement, efficiency, practicality, scalability, and impact.

2. Automated Analytics Reports: Generates periodic summaries of patient data, including stage transitions, sentiment trends, and scoring metrics.
3. Customizable Metrics: Supports custom metrics for efficiency, business value, scalability, and impact.
4. Simulated Data: Includes a built-in function to simulate patient data for testing and demos.

**Tech Stack**

- Fetch.AI: For decentralized agent deployment and communication.
- Python: Core programming language.
- uAgents Framework: For agent creation and interaction.
- Logging: For detailed tracking of analytics and processes.

**Getting Started**

Fetch.AI account
Python 3.8+
Dependencies: Install using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Setup

- Clone the Repository:
``
`git` clone <repository_url>
cd vaxinsight
`
- Install Dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**How to Use** 

- Simulate Data
The agent includes a simulate_test_data() function to send test patient data automatically every 10 seconds. It generates logs with patient statistics and scores.

- Send Custom Data
Use a tool like Postman or Python to send PatientJourneyEvent messages to the agentâ€™s /submit endpoint. Example payload:

json
`
{
  "patient_id": "PATIENT001",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "journey_stage": "accepting",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00",
  "notes": "Example patient journey data",
  "metrics": {
    "process_efficiency": 0.9,
    "business_value": 0.8,
    "scalability_potential": 0.7,
    "impact_factor": 0.85
  },
  "tech_features": ["AI", "Blockchain", "Machine Learning"]
}

### Notes:
1. **Image Files**: 
   - You need to upload your images (e.g., `dashboard_overview.png`, `real_time_analytics.png`, `data_flow_example.png`) to a folder in your Git repository, such as `/images/`.
   - Ensure the image files are correctly referenced in the markdown (`images/dashboard_overview.png`).

2. **Repository URL**: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

3. **Customization**: Customize the text and images to better reflect your project and its functionalities.

This approach will render the images in your README file when viewed on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, etc.
